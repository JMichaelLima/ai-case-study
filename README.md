# Hugging Face - ai-case-study

## Overview and Origin

* **Hugging Face** was founded 2016 by Clement Delangue, Julien Chaumond, and Thomas Wolf. [^1]

* Initially conceived as a chatbot app for which they raised $1.2 million.[^2] While the team at Hugging Face made massive leaps in the underlying Natural Language Processing (NLP) technology, these improvements were not correlating with improved growth or user retention. [^3] After a couple of years focusing on the chat app Hugging Face open sourced the entire model to focus on building a machine learning platform, a community focused on collaboration, and simple to access cloud compute for developers and companies building AI products. As of August, 2023, Hugging Face has raised $235 million and in its latest round they raised at a valuation of $4.5 billion. [^4]

## Business Activities

> Hugging Face describes itself as *"GitHub for machine learning"* [^4]. 

Their platform, like GitHub, serves both independent developers as well as very large enterprise customers with repositories, open source libraries, NLP models, and compute power across several different hardware configurations. [^5] 

## Results and Growth

Hugging Face recently crossed over 1 million repositories with hopes to cross into the tens of millions next year. [^4] Annualized revenue is estimate at between $30 - $50 million.[^6]

## Closing Thought and Recommendations

The AI revolution has barely begun and companies like Hugging Face are in a great spot providing the "picks and shovels" to those developers and companies which will define how that revolution changes society in ways that no one can forsee at this early stage. 

Investing heavily in the education portion of their website could pay massive future dividends in driving developer adoption resulting in rapidly growing recurring revenue as more companies are built on their compute platform.

Embracing open source as they have, Hugging Face may have an unfair advantage over any future competitors. The history of open source software indicates that an incumbent market leader has only to stay the course and not alienate its most passionate users to succeed. As long as Hugging Face continues to improve the AI developer experience they will be well positioned for wherever the AI revolution take us.
